# Israeli Halva
This is an imitation of the halva (dry halwa) I had in the Israeli Negev Desert. It can be very rich depending on what tahini you use.  
Adapted from [this recipe](https://youtu.be/64_ckmBf01M) and [this](https://youtu.be/sfAaV5EGfYY).  
**Preparation time**: minimum 30 minutes, max 90 minutes, larger batches take longer. (depends on cooling and mixing time; slower generally means better product)  
**Curing time**: at least 12 hours.  

## Ingredients  
- 2 cups sugar (403 g)
- 1/2 cup water (118 g)
- 2 cups<b>*</b> of Tahini Paste (450 g tahini)
- 1 tsp vanilla extract (5 mL)

#### optional ingredients:  
- up to 2 cup peanut butter. <b>*</b>The combination of Tahini and Peanut Butter should add up to 2 cups (473 mL total).  
- spices: some cultures like to add Cinnamon, Nutmeg, Rose Water, chocolate, coffee, or Pistachio and other nut crumbles. These would be added to the tahini/peanut butter mix. See `expert tips` for more info.  

### Tools
- medium pot
- 2 cup wet container
- dry measuring cups
- stirring utensils
- bread pan(s) (for curing)
- plate (for waste)
- stove top (for heating)

#### Optional tools:  
- parchment paper (to prevent sticking)
- candy thermometer
- plastic wrap
- microwave oven

## Procedure
1. Fill a medium pot with 1/2 cup water and 2 cups sugar, and place on medium heat.
2. Stir the pot occasionally until it gets close to boiling (~200°F or 90°C can be earlier)
3. Warm the Tahini to at least 120°F (up to 160°F or 40-60°C), either in a bowl in the microwave or in a small pot on the stove. Also mix in the peanut butter and nut crumbles at this time if using.
4. Add the vanilla (and seasonings if using) to the warm tahini and stir to an even consistency.  
5. Once the sugar solution is heavily boiling (<a href="approximation.md" title="This is approximate, I don't have a good thermometer." style="text-color:grey;">~230°F or 105°C</a>), change the heat to low and add the Tahini mixture. Mix until it is an even consistency. It may take a lot of mixing, as the Tahini tends to float on top of the sugar. Once it is at an even consistency slowly turn off the heat, but keep stirring the mixture.   
Continue stirring until the mixture thickens and becomes airy. The more you stir the mixture before putting it in the cooling pan, the more fluffy and together the final product will be. If you stir it less time, the product will be flaky and fall apart easily. See `Troubleshooting` and `Expert Tips` for more info.  
6. Pour the mixture into an 8X8 Pyrex pan or 2 breadpans (or 1 breadpan if you want it extra thick). You can line the pan with parchment paper if desired. Pat the halva down to fill the bottom of the pan and make a more even shape.  
7. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for at least 12 hours to let halva cure.  
8. Cut the halva into squares and enjoy! It is great as a quick hearty breakfast, snack, or even a dessert. Tastes good plain or with nutella or chocolate spread.  


### notes
* Do not refrigetate the halva, that changes the texture.
* In general larger batches make more consistent results, but require more time to cool and mix properly, e.g. a triple batch takes about 2 hours.  
* Step 1: The sugar solution should be oversaturated to enable good crystallization later. Do not cover the sugar water, as the drips make it heat unevenly.  
* Step 5a: If the tahini is too cold it won't mix into the sugar as well. This is why you can't add more tahini after you've already started mixing.  
* Step 5b: Some oiliness can be good, but if there seems to be too much excess oil you can pour it off or absorb with a paper towel.  

#### Troubleshooting
Too much water, the product will be less held together.  
Not enough mixing, the product will be flaky; not held together.  
Too much mixing, the product will be crumbly; not held together. Note: some crumbs or flakiness is ok, it is up to personal taste.  

### Expert Tips
Add any spices to the Tahini/Peanut Butter mix before heating. The warmer the tahini is, the easier it will be to properly mix it into the sugar water.  
You can use any kind of paste in place of the 2c Tahini.  
Example mixtures:  
* 1.9c Peanut butter, cut peanuts, 1 Tsp Vanilla, 1/4 Tbsp Nutmeg, 1/8 Tsp Cloves.  
* 1.4c Tahini, .5c Peanut butter, 2 Tbsp small Cacao Nibs, 1 Tsp Vanilla, 1/4 Tsp Nutmeg.  
* 1.9c Tahini paste, pistachio nut crumbles, 1 Tsp Vanilla.  
* (double recipe) 4c Tahini paste, .5c crushed peanut bits, 2.2tsp vanilla, Nutmeg, Cinnamon.
