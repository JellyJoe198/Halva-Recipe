# Halva-Recipe
This is similar to the halva (dry halwa) I had in the Israeli Negev Desert.  
Adapted from [this recipie](https://youtu.be/64_ckmBf01M) and also [this](https://youtu.be/sfAaV5EGfYY)

## Ingredients  
- 2 cups of sugar
- 1/2 cup water
- 1 1/2 cup of Tahini Paste
- 1 light tsp vanilla extract  

__optional:__  
- up to 1 cup peanut butter

### Optional tools:  
- parchment paper (to prevent sticking)
- candy thermometer

## Procedure
1. Fill a medium pot with 1/2 cup water and 2 cups sugar, and place on medium heat. 
2. Stir the pot occasionally until it gets close to boiling (~200°F)
3. Warm the Tahini to ~100°F,  either in a bowl in the microwave or in a small pot on the stove.  Warming the tahini is mostly just so you have more time to mix the tahini in before the sugar starts cooling and crystalizing. Also warm the peanut butter at this time if using. 
4. Add the vanilla to the warm tahini and stir to an even consistency.  
5. Once the sugar solution is heavily boiling (~240°F), pour the Tahini in and mix. Also mix in the peanut butter at this time if using. Once it is an even consistency you can stop mixing, but it is up to your preference. Less mixing means a more flaky product, more mixing means a more puffy and stringy product. You can also add the peanut butter later if you want it to stand out more in the halva.  
6. Pour the mixture into an 8X8 pyrex pan and let sit for at least 24 hours to let halva cure as it cools. You can line the pan with parchment paper if desired.   
7. Cut the halva into squares and enjoy! It is great as a quick hearty breakfast or even a dessert.
