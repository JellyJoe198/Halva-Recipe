# Israeli Halva
This is an imitation of the halva (dry halwa) I had in the Israeli Negev Desert.  
Adapted from [this recipe](https://youtu.be/64_ckmBf01M) and [this](https://youtu.be/sfAaV5EGfYY)  
**Preparation time**: minimum 30 minutes, max 90 minutes. (depends on mixing time; slower generally means better product)  
**Curing time**: at least 12 hours.  

## Ingredients  
- 2 cups of sugar (403 g)
- 1/2 cup water (118 g)
- 2 cups<b>*</b> of Tahini Paste (450 g tahini)
- 1 light tsp vanilla extract (5 mL)

#### optional ingeredients:  
- up to 2 cup peanut butter. <b>*</b>The combination of Tahini and Peanut Butter should add up to 2 cups (473 mL total).  
- spices: some cultures like to add Cinnamon, Nutmeg, Rose Water, chocolate, coffee, or Pistachio and other nut crumbles. These would be added to the tahini/peanut butter mix. See `expert tips` for more info.  

### Tools
- medium pot
- 2 cup wet container
- dry measuring cups
- stirring utensils
- bread pan(s) (for curing)
- plate (for waste)
- stove top (for heating)

#### Optional tools:  
- parchment paper (to prevent sticking)
- candy thermometer
- plastic wrap (to cover halva while curing)
- microwave oven

## Procedure
1. Fill a medium pot with 1/2 cup water and 2 cups sugar, and place on medium heat.
2. Stir the pot occasionally until it gets close to boiling (~200°F or 90°C can be earlier)
3. Warm the Tahini to 100°F (up to 160°F or 50-60°C), either in a bowl in the microwave or in a small pot on the stove. Also mix in the peanut butter at this time if using.
4. Add the vanilla (and seasonings if using) to the warm tahini and stir to an even consistency.  
5. Once the sugar solution is heavily boiling (<a href="approximation.md" title="This is approximate, I don't have a good thermometer." style="text-color:grey;">~230°F or 105°C</a>), change the heat to low and add the Tahini mixture. Mix until it is an even consistency. It may take a lot of mixing, as the Tahini tends to float on top of the sugar. Once it is at an even consistency, turn off the heat, but keep stirring the mixture.   
Continue stirring until the mixture thickens and becomes airy. The more you stir the mixture before putting it in the cooling pan, the more fluffy and together the final product will be. If you stir it less time, the product will be flaky and fall apart easily. See `Troubleshooting` and `Expert Tips` for more info.  
6. Pour the mixture into an 8X8 Pyrex pan or 2 breadpans (or 1 breadpan if you want it extra thick). You can line the pan with parchment paper if desired. Pat the halva down to fill the bottom of the pan and make a more even shape.  
7. Cover and let sit at room temperature for at least 12 hours to let halva cure.  
8. Cut the halva into squares and enjoy! It is great as a quick hearty breakfast, snack, or even a dessert. Tastes good plain or with nutella or chocolate spread.  


### notes
Step 1: The sugar solution should be oversaturated to enable good crystallization later. Do not cover the sugar water, as the drips make it heat unevenly.  
Step 5a: If you are too slow pouring the tahini in, it may become uneven and some chunks of tahini will become stuck in the mixture.   
Step 5b: If there seems to be excess oil, you probably added too much water or used a bad tahini/peanut butter. This will make the product less pleasant, but you can pour off the excess oil (or dry with paper towel) before putting it into curing pan. This is not as important if you plan to eat the halva with silverware.

#### Troubleshooting
Too much water, the product will be moist/oily and less held together.  
Not enough mixing, the product will be too flaky.  
Too much mixing, the product will be too crumbly; not held together. Note: some crumbs are ok, it is up to taste.  

### Expert Tips
Add any spices to the Tahini/Peanut Butter mix before heating. The warmer the tahini is, the easier it will be to properly mix it into the sugar water.  
You can use any kind of paste in place of the 2c Tahini.  
Example mixtures:  
* 1.9c Peanut butter, cut peanuts, 1 Tbsp Vanilla, 1/4 Tbsp Nutmeg, 1/8 Tbsp Cloves.  
* 1.4c Peanut butter, .5c Tahini, 2 Tbsp small Cacao Nibs, 1 Tbsp Vanilla, 1/4 Tbsp Nutmeg.  
* 1.9c Tahini paste, pistachio nut crumbles, 1 Tbsp Vanilla.
