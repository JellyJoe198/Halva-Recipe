# Halva-Recipie
this is similar to the halva (dry halwa) I had in the Israeli Negev Desert  
adapted from [this recipie](https://youtu.be/64_ckmBf01M) and also [this](https://youtu.be/sfAaV5EGfYY)

### Ingredients  
- 2 cups of sugar
- 1/2 cup water
- 1 1/2 cup of Tahini Paste
- 1 light tsp vanilla extract  

optional:  
- 1 cup peanut butter

### Tools
- 1 medium pot
- 1 small pot or bowl (for the tahini)
- measuring cups (1 for dry, 1 for wet)  
- heating stove
__optional:__  
- candy thermometer
- microwave

### Procedure
1. Fill the medium pot with 1/2 cup water and 2 cups sugar, and place that on heat. 
2. Stir the medium pot occasionally until it gets close to boiling (~200°F)
3. Heat up the Tahini to ~100°F. This could be in a bowl in a microwave or in a small pot on the stove, it is just so that we have time to mix the 2 parts before the sugar cools. 
4. Once the sugar is heavily boiling (~240°F),   
_note: not completed_
