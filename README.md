# Halva-Recipie
this is similar to the halva (dry halwa) I had in the Israeli Negev Desert  
adapted from [this recipie](https://youtu.be/64_ckmBf01M) and also [this](https://youtu.be/sfAaV5EGfYY)

## Ingredients  
- 2 cups of sugar
- 1/2 cup water
- 1 1/2 cup of Tahini Paste
- 1 light tsp vanilla extract  

__optional:__  
- 1 cup peanut butter

### Tools
- 1 medium pot
- 1 small pot or bowl (for the tahini)
- measuring cups (1 for dry, 1 for wet)  
- heating stove
- 8x8inch pan or 2 bread pans (to let halva cool in)  

__optional:__  
- parchment paper (to make it not stick to cooling pan)
- candy thermometer
- microwave
- refrigerator

## Procedure
1. Fill the medium pot with 1/2 cup water and 2 cups sugar, and place that on heat. 
2. Stir the medium pot occasionally until it gets close to boiling (~200°F)
3. Heat up the Tahini to ~100°F. This could be in a bowl in a microwave or in a small pot on the stove, it is just so that we have time to mix the 2 parts before the sugar cools. Also heat the peanut butter at this time. 
4. Add the vanilla to the tahini and stir to an even consistency.  
5. Once the sugar is heavily boiling (~240°F), pour the Tahini in and mix. Also mix in the peanut butter at this time. Once it is an even consistency you can stop mixing, but it is up to your preference. Less mixing means a more flaky product, more mixing means a more puffy and stringy product.  
6. Pour the mixture into the cooling pan and Let sit for at least 24 hours to let halva cure as it cools. After the 24 hours place the halva in the fridge if you want it to cure even further.
