# Halva-Recipe
This is similar to the halva (dry halwa) I had in the Israeli Negev Desert.  
Adapted from [this recipe](https://youtu.be/64_ckmBf01M) and also [this](https://youtu.be/sfAaV5EGfYY)

## Ingredients  
- 2 cups of sugar
- 1/2 cup water
- 2 cups* of Tahini Paste
- 1 light tsp vanilla extract  

#### optional:  
- up to 1/2 cup peanut butter. *The sum of Tahini and Peanut Butter should add up to 2 cups. 

### Optional tools:  
- parchment paper (to prevent sticking)
- candy thermometer

## Procedure
1. Fill a medium pot with 1/2 cup water and 2 cups sugar, and place on medium heat.
2. Stir the pot occasionally until it gets close to boiling (~200°F)
3. Warm the Tahini to ~100°F, either in a bowl in the microwave or in a small pot on the stove. Also warm the peanut butter at this time if using.
4. Add the vanilla to the warm tahini and stir to an even consistency. Also mix the peanut butter in at this time if using.
5. Once the sugar solution is heavily boiling (~240°F), change the heat to low and add the Tahini mixture. Mix until it is an even consistency. It may take a lot of mixing, as the Tahini tends to float on top of the sugar. Once it is at an even consistency, turn off the heat, but keep stirring the mixture.  
Continue stirring until the mixture thickens and becomes airy. The more you stir the mixture before putting it in the cooling pan, the more fluffy and together the final product will be. If you stir it less time, the product will be flaky and fall apart easily.  
6. Pour the mixture into an 8X8 Pyrex pan or 2 breadpans. You can line the pan with parchment paper if desired. Pat it down to fill the bottom of the pan to make the halva more evenly shaped.
7. Cover and let sit at room temperature for at least 12 hours to let halva cure.
8. Cut the halva into squares and enjoy! It is great as a quick hearty breakfast, snack, or even a dessert.
