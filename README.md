# Halva-Recipe
This is similar to the halva (dry halwa) I had in the Israeli Negev Desert.  
Adapted from [this recipie](https://youtu.be/64_ckmBf01M) and also [this](https://youtu.be/sfAaV5EGfYY)

## Ingredients  
- 2 cups of sugar
- 1/2 cup water
- 2 cup* of Tahini Paste
- 1 light tsp vanilla extract  

__optional:__  
- up to 1/2 cup peanut butter. *The sum of Tahini and Peanut Butter should add up to 2 cups. 

### Optional tools:  
- parchment paper (to prevent sticking)
- candy thermometer

## Procedure
1. Fill a medium pot with 1/2 cup water and 2 cups sugar, and place on medium heat. 
2. Stir the pot occasionally until it gets close to boiling (~200°F)
3. Warm the Tahini to ~100°F, either in a bowl in the microwave or in a small pot on the stove. Also warm the peanut butter at this time if using.  
4. Add the vanilla to the warm tahini and stir to an even consistency. Also mix the peanut butter in at this time if using. 
5. Once the sugar solution is heavily boiling (~240°F), turn the heat to low and add the Tahini mixture and mix. It may take a lot of mixing, as the Tahini tends to float on top of the sugar. 
Keep mixing until the mixture starts acting more like bread dough than a liquid. It will thicken slightly and become more airy.  
6. Pour the mixture into an 8X8 pyrex pan or 2 breadpans. You can line the pan with parchment paper if desired, though it is not usually necessary. 
Pat it down to fill the bottom of the pan to make the halva more evenly shaped. 
Let sit for at least 24 hours to let halva cure as it cools.  
7. Cut the halva into squares and enjoy! It is great as a quick hearty breakfast or even a dessert.
