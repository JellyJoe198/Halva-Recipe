# Halva-Recipe
This is similar to the halva (dry halwa) I had in the Israeli Negev Desert.  
Adapted from recipes I found on YouTube

## Ingredients  
- 2 cups of sugar
- 1/2 cup water
- 1 1/2 cup of Tahini Paste
- 1 light tsp vanilla extract  

__optional:__  
- 1 cup peanut butter

## Tools
- 1 medium pot
- 1 small pot or bowl (for the tahini)
- measuring cups (1 for dry, 1 for wet)  
- heating stove
- 8x8inch pan or 2 bread pans (to let halva cool in)  

__optional:__  
- parchment paper (to make it not stick to cooling pan)
- candy thermometer
- microwave
- refrigerator

## Procedure
1. Fill a medium pot with 1/2 cup water and 2 cups sugar, and place on medium heat. 
2. Stir the pot occasionally until it gets close to boiling (~200°F)
3. Warm the Tahini to ~100°F,  either in a bowl in the microwave or in a small pot on the stove.  Warming the tahini is just so you have more time to mix the tahini in before the sugar starts cooling and crystalizing. Also warm the peanut butter at this time if using. 
4. Add the vanilla to the warm tahini and stir to an even consistency.  
5. Once the sugar mixture is heavily boiling (~240°F), pour the Tahini in and mix. Also mix in the peanut butter at this time if using. Once it is an even consistency you can stop mixing, but it is up to your preference. Less mixing means a more flaky product, more mixing means a more puffy and stringy product.  
6. Pour the mixture into an 8 X 8 pyrex pan and let sit for at least 24 hours to let halva cure as it cools. You can line the pan with parchment paper if desired.   
7. Cut the halva into squares and enjoy! It is great as a quick hearty breakfast or even a dessert.
